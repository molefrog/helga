## Knife
Interactive web-experiment which involves physical simulation of a particle system. The demo also supports Leap Motion.

### Background 
So, I finally got Leap Motion device (http://leapmotion.com/) through their developer program. After realizing that it supports JavaScript (without any extensions, it just works over WebSocket), I started writing a small demo, based on my previous work with simple particle system.

I used LiveReload plugin to speed up the development process and get really cool live visualizations.
The full list of used tools and libraries:

  1. SublimeText + LiveReload
  2. Leap.js (http://github.com/leapmotion/leapjs) - Leap Motion JavaScript library
  3. Sketch.js (http://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/) - simple drawing framework for web-experiments by Justin Windle
  4. dat.gui (http://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/) - simple gui for parameter tweaking
